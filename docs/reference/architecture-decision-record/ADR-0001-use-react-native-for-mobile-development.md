# ADR-0001: Use React Native for Mobile Development

## Date
2025-01-11

## Status
Accepted

## Context/Problem Statement
SnapScope is a mobile application designed to help insurance adjusters and inspectors capture and organize vehicle photos with specific labeling requirements. The app needs to work reliably in remote areas with limited connectivity, provide native camera integration with overlays and prompts, and offer local storage capabilities for offline work. The solution must be maintainable by the current development team and provide a native-like experience on both iOS and Android platforms.

## Decision
We will use Expo React Native as the primary framework for developing the SnapScope mobile application.

## Decision Drivers
- **Cross-platform requirement**: Need to support both iOS and Android with a single codebase
- **Team expertise**: TypeScript is well known by the developers, and Expo React Native uses TypeScript/JavaScript
- **Native device capabilities**: Must access the mobile device's camera with custom overlays and offline storage
- **Field usage requirements**: App must work reliably in remote areas using minimal equipment with full offline functionality

## Considered Options
1. **Expo React Native** - Cross-platform framework with strong TypeScript support and native module access
2. **Ionic** - Less familiar to the team and may have limitations with native camera integrations
3. **Flutter** - Lesser known technology that would require learning Dart
4. **Native Development (Swift + Kotlin)** - Would require maintaining two separate codebases
5. **Progressive Web App (PWA)** - Mobile-first approach that won't provide the integrated native experience required

## Decision Outcome
We selected Expo React Native because it:
- Allows us to maintain a single codebase for both iOS and Android
- Leverages the team's existing TypeScript/JavaScript expertise
- Provides excellent native module support for camera access and local storage
- Has a mature ecosystem with libraries like expo-media-library for our specific needs
- Offers the native-like performance and user experience required for field use

## Consequences

### Positive
- Faster development with a single codebase for both platforms
- Ability to share code and logic between iOS and Android
- Large community and extensive third-party library support
- Hot reloading for faster development cycles
- Native performance for camera operations and file handling

### Negative
- Potential performance overhead compared to fully native apps
- May require native module development for very specific features
- Debugging can be more complex than pure web or native development
- Need to manage Expo React Native version updates and breaking changes

## Validation
Success will be measured by:
- Performance benchmarks for camera operations (capture time < 2 seconds)
- User satisfaction metrics from field testing
- Development velocity measurements (feature delivery time)
- Cross-platform consistency testing (UI/UX parity between iOS and Android)
- Offline functionality verification in areas with no connectivity

## Related Decisions/Dependencies
- Choice of local storage solution (AsyncStorage vs expo-media-library)
- Google Drive API integration approach
- Camera overlay implementation strategy
- State management solution for Expo React Native
