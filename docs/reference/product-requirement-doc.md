# SnapScope - Product Requirements Document

**Version 1.1 | MVP Specification**

## Overview

SnapScope is a mobile application designed to streamline the vehicle damage assessment process for insurance adjusters. The application addresses the current inefficiencies in manual photo documentation and spec sheet completion by providing a structured digital workflow that reduces assessment time and improves accuracy.

## Problem Statement

Insurance adjusters currently spend excessive time on manual processes during vehicle damage assessments. The most significant pain point is the hand-written spec sheet completion, which occurs after photo documentation. Additionally, organizing and compiling assessment deliverables for claim submission creates administrative overhead that delays the claims process.

## Objectives

The MVP aims to digitize and streamline the core assessment workflow, focusing on photo organization and automated report compilation. The primary goal is to reduce total assessment time by 40% while maintaining documentation quality and improving deliverable consistency.

## User Persona

**Primary User: Insurance Adjuster**

- Field-based professional conducting vehicle damage assessments
- Requires mobile solution for on-site documentation
- Values efficiency and accuracy in damage reporting
- Familiar with standardized assessment protocols
- Needs consistent, professional deliverables for claim submission

## Core Features

### Vehicle Identification

The application must capture and verify vehicle identification numbers to ensure accurate claim association. This verification step prevents documentation errors and maintains claim integrity.

### Structured Photo Documentation

The system shall guide adjusters through a standardized photo sequence including interior shots and eight exterior positions: left side, front left quarter, front, front right quarter, right side, rear right quarter, rear with license plate, and rear left quarter. Each photo position will be clearly labeled and tracked for completion status.

### Damage Annotation System

Each captured photo requires associated damage descriptions and labels. The application should provide predefined damage categories and severity levels while allowing custom annotations for unique situations.

### Report Export Functionality

The application must generate comprehensive assessment deliverables in a standardized format. For the MVP, the system shall export a zip file containing all captured photos with organized file naming conventions and corresponding text files that contain the damage labels and annotations for each image. This export feature addresses the critical need for consistent, professional deliverables that can be immediately submitted for claim processing.

### Digital Spec Sheet Generation

The system should populate standard assessment fields based on captured photos and damage annotations, presenting remaining fields for adjuster completion to reduce manual data entry. This feature will be implemented in future iterations following the core export functionality.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform

React Native with Expo framework for cross-platform iOS and Android deployment.

### Camera Integration

High-resolution photo capture with metadata preservation, including GPS coordinates and timestamps for each image.

### Data Storage

Local device storage for assessment data with cloud backup capabilities for completed assessments.

### Export Generation

File compression and organization capabilities to create structured zip archives containing photos and corresponding label text files with consistent naming conventions.

### User Interface

Intuitive workflow progression with clear visual indicators for completed and pending tasks. The interface should accommodate field use conditions including bright sunlight and gloved hands.

## Success Metrics

Assessment completion time reduction of at least 40% compared to current manual process. Photo documentation accuracy measured by required retakes or missing images. Deliverable compilation time reduction measured from assessment completion to final export generation. User adoption rate among adjuster teams following initial deployment.

## MVP Scope Limitations

The initial version focuses exclusively on documentation and basic report export generation. Advanced features such as PDF spec sheet generation, AI-powered damage detection, integration with existing insurance systems, and collaborative review workflows are excluded from the MVP scope but planned for subsequent releases.

This specification provides the foundation for developing a functional prototype that addresses the core inefficiencies in the current vehicle damage assessment process while establishing a framework for comprehensive deliverable generation.
