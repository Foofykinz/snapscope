# SnapScope PRD

SnapScope is a mobile app designed to streamline vehicle photo documentation for independent appraisers firms, and carriers. It provides guided, step-by-step photo capture with automatic labeling and secure file management. By ensuring that all required photos are captured in the correct order and saved properly, SnapScope minimizes the risk of missed shots and labeling errors — reducing rework, saving time, and improving compliance for both IA’s and the firms they serve.

## **Core Goals**

* **Standardize** the photo documentation process across teams and firms

* **Improve photo quality** by guiding framing and detecting blur

* **Support field use** with offline functionality and fast workflows

* **Reduce back-and-forth** between firms and adjusters due to photo errors

* **Give adjusters control** over how they organize and export their work

* **Simplify compliance** with firm- and carrier-specific photo requirements

* **Enable fast onboarding** for new users with an intuitive interface

**Problems SnapScope Can Solve:**

1. **Missed required photos** inspection environments are often fast paced and at times chaotic.

2. **Incorrect or unlabeled images**  manual photo labeling is tedious and error-prone, leading to rework or file rejection

3. **Wasted Time Organizing** Sorting, naming, and exporting photos after inspections can slow workflows and delay file submissions

4. **Carrier/Firm requirements are inconsistent** Each company has different photo requirements and IA’s may struggle to remember whats needed for each file

5. **Lack of structured photo process** No step by step guidance results in sloppy or non compliant photo sets

6. **QA for photo quality** Blurry or poorly framed photos often go unnoticed until its too late, causing file delays or complaints


### **MVP Scope**

* Step-by-step photo capture with prompt overlay

* Native camera usage with 4:3 ratio

* Blur detection with override

* Manual damage photo labeling

* Option to save to phone or Google Drive

* Local job folder creation and access

* File manager to view, delete, resume, or export saved jobs

* Carrier/firm selection step that loads custom photo list

* Settings area to edit, add, or remove photo prompt lists

**Core Workflow**

* User opens the app and sees the animated SnapScope logo screen.

* Home screen displays three options: New File, Manage Files, Settings.

* User selects "New File" and is prompted to enter a job name (Claim Number or Vehicle Type).

* User selects a carrier/firm which loads a custom photo list in a dropdown.

* Native camera opens in 4:3 mode with slightly transparent outer frame overlay for the first photo prompt.

* User takes each required photo with guidance and blur detection (with override option).

* Photos are saved locally with automatic labels that will stay put even after file transfer.

* After required photos are done, the user enters "Damage Mode" to manually label damage photos.

* After a damage photo is taken, a translucent text box will appear and prompt the user for a name, or user can “skip” this step or if finished, hit “complete capture” in the upper right corner.

* Optional: User has the option to complete scope notes after photos are complete.

* User selects "Save and Complete File."

* App prompts user to export the file to either phone storage or Google Drive.

* App returns to the Home screen.

* From "Manage Files," users can resume jobs, export, delete, or re-label.

* From "Settings," users can:

  * Manage carriers/firms and their custom photo lists

  * Enable/disable Google Drive integration (login required)

  * Toggle app themes and other preferences
