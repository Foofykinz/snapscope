2. Date: When the decision was made.
3. Status: Proposed, Accepted, Superseded, Deprecated, or Rejected.
4. Context/Problem Statement: What is the context or problem leading to this decision?
4. Decision: What is being decided?
6. Decision Drivers: What forces, requirements, or concerns influenced the decision?
7. Considered Options: What alternatives were evaluated?
8. Decision Outcome: Which option was selected and why?
9. Consequences: What are the positive/negative effects and implications?
10. Validation: How will/can you confirm this decision was successful?
11. Related Decisions/Dependencies: Reference any past/future decisions linked to this one.
12. Contributors/Reviewers: Who participated in making/reviewing this decision?
