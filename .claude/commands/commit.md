description: Creates a new commit using conventional commit guidelines.
---

Review the git changes in the working directory and stage them for commit.

```bash
# to review staged changes
git diff --cached

# to review unstaged changes
git diff

# to stage all changes
git reset

# to review unstaged changes
git add .
```

## Commit format

- Always conventional commit guidelines to create a new commit.
- The body should be concise, descriptive and in the imperative mood. Be complete but not verbose.
- Never mention Claude, Claude Code, or AI in the commit message.
- Use the present tense, e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature".

## Behavior

- If there are no staged changes, commit all unstaged changes.
- If there are staged changes, only commit those.
- If there are no changes, do not create a commit. Say "No changes to commit."
- If there was an issue with GPG signing, immediately try to commit without GPG signing.
- immediately git push. If a force push is required, use `git push --force-with-lease` to avoid overwriting others' work.
- If there is a PR open for the current branch, after pushing the commit, update the PR accordingly.
  - If the commit fixes an issue, make sure to link the issue in the PR description.
